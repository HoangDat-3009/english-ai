Subject: Questions about Office Relocation

Dear HR Team,

Thank you for the memo about our upcoming office relocation. I have a few questions:

1. Will the new building have dedicated parking for employees who use electric vehicles? I recently purchased an electric car and would need access to charging stations.

2. You mentioned that the IT department will transfer our computers. Should we back up our personal files, or will IT handle that as well?

3. I currently work from home two days per week. Will this flexible arrangement continue at the new location?

4. Are there any plans to organize a tour of the new facility before the move? It would be helpful to see the workspace in advance.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
David Martinez
Software Development Team
